This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript closure issue encountered when using `setTimeout` within a loop. The example shows how the final value of `i` is logged for each iteration, rather than the value at the time of each `setTimeout` call.  The solution demonstrates how to use an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE) to correctly capture the value of `i` within each iteration.
